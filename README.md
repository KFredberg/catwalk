# core-data-modelling

This repository will host a UI designed to assist in creating great data models.

In the meanwhile, here is a couple of prototypes:

* Prototype for exploring the data model: [prototype1 branch](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-data-modelling/tree/prototype1)
* Prototype for validating the data model: [prototype2 branch](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-data-modelling/tree/prototype2)
